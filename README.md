# BME Projects
## This repository contains code that I have worked on during my Master's program

* Arduino pressure sensor is for a pressure sensor using force sensing resistors
* The IKRyne matlab file is for my master's directed project.
* The kinect fall detection project was using a Kinect V2 to detect falls and is written in processing using openCV and the KinectV2 for processing library
